fishTrax provides a closed loop system for monitoring and recording the position of fish in a tank while simultanouely delivering sensory stimuli both visual and electric.

fishTrax works with the following hardware:
Camera - AVT or OpenCV High gui comopatible.
Projector or Monitor
Arduino
(Todo: Labjack or Nidaq (window only)

fishTrax is designed to abstract away all the complexity of interfacing with the hardware and tracking the fish, so that it is easy to create new experiments.

To start it run:
python ArenaControllerMainWindow.py

To create an experiment:
For each experiment you want to run, you need to write a controller object.  To do this you need to extend subclass the contorller class, and fill in the missing functions:

Tuning the fish tracking:

Analysis tools:

1) UI
2) Projector Display
3) Experiment State
4) ...
